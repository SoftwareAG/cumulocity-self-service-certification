## Repository Purpose and How to Get Started

This repository provides documentation about the certification tool offered by Software AG. This tool is the core component of the self-service-certification for hardware manufacturers that want to test and certify their integrations with Cumulocity IoT. The tool can be used within the certification tenant that will be provided during the technical onboarding process. The onboarding will be initiated after a user registerd at the public [Device Partner Portal](https://devicepartnerportal.softwareag.com/) and created a company profile. 

The integration of the hardware has to fulfill the foundation capabilities to be certifyable. The certification tool can be used to test and certify any other capability exceeding the foundation capabilities. The detailed technical description of the integration can be found in the document [Vendor Requirements](./docs/vendor-requirements.md). It covers the registration process, the foundation capabilities, and most of the extended capabilities that are supported by Cumulocity IoTs device management. 




## Diagrams & Graphics

The files [Endpoints](./docs/endpoints.md) and [Information Model](./docs/information-model.md) provide inside information on the tool. Interested readers can consume this information to get a deeper understanding of the tool itself.
