## Purpose of this Repository

This repository provides documentation about the certification tool offered by Software AG. This tool is the core component of the self-service-certification for hardware manufacturers that want to test and certify their integrations with Cumulocity IoT. The tool can be used as part of the certification tenant that will be provided as part of the technical onboarding process. The onboarding will start after a user registerd at the public [Device Partner Portal](https://devicepartnerportal.softwareag.com/) and created a company profile after a first onboarding meeting. 

The integration of the hardware has to fulfill certain foundation capabilities to be certifyable. The certification tool can be used to test and certify any other capability exceeding the foundation capabilities. The detailed technical description of the integration can be found in the document [Vendor Requirements](./docs/vendor-requirements.md). It covers the registration process, the foundation capabilities, and most of the extended capabilities that are supported by Cumulocity IoTs device management.
